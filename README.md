# URLockBox

## Setup

The URLockbox can be set up easily.

1. Clone done this repo.
2. Bundle
3. rake db:setup
4. To run the test suite, rspec
    Note: You will need to download version 46 of Firefox [here](https://www.softexia.com/windows/web-browsers/firefox-46). If you do have it, make sure it is on version 46. Selenium does not work with all versions of Firefox, so make sure that you are using Firefox 46 or else it will potentially cause you problems.

    If you already have Firefox and it's on a version more recent than 46, the easiest way to downgrade is to uninstall Firefox then install version 46.

#### Using the app

The URLockbox has a companion app, https://rocky-atoll-70277.herokuapp.com/ that tracks
